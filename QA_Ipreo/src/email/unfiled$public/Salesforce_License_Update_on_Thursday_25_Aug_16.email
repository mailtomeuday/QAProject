Ipreo Salesforce "Chatter Plus" Users:

We are updating your Salesforce License on Thursday, 25-Aug-16.
The update will not limit the Salesforce access that you currently have.
The purpose of the update is primarily to enable visibility of selected Salesforce Opportunities.  The Salesforce team or your manager will be contacting you in the near future with more information about when and why you will be viewing Opportunities.

If you run into any issues using Salesforce on Thursday, or going forward, please email  salesforce_support@ipreo.com.

Thanks for using Salesforce!
