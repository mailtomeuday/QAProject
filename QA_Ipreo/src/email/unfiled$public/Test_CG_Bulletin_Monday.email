shareholder’s review pertaining to a company’s advisory vote on executive
compensation includes how your company stacks up relative to peers in terms of
level of pay and shareholder returns. Despite the ranking results, those
companies who have established a compensation program with the specific
objective of aligning the interests of the company with shareholders have a
much better chance of getting a favorable Say-on-Pay vote result. On the flip
side shareholders and proxy advisors will give greater scrutiny to the
Compensation, Discussion and Analysis section of the proxy for companies with a
low pay for performance result relative to peers, or just high pay relative to
peers. They will review it for best practices and will judge whether the plan
design is sufficiently performance based.</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-size:10.5pt;line-height:115%;

context of the company’s stated strategy and identified value drivers and seek
to understand the link between strategy, value drivers and incentive plan
design. We examine both target and realizable compensation in order to
understand the compensation committee’s intended outcomes, to judge the
appropriateness and rigor of performance measures and hurdles, and to assess
the pay plan’s sensitivity to the performance of the company. We conduct our
analysis over various time horizons, with an emphasis on a sustained period,
generally 3-5 years; however we consider company-specific factors, including
the timeframe the company uses for performance evaluation, the nature of the
industry, and the typical business cycle, in order to identify an appropriate
timeframe for evaluation. We evaluate the structure of the compensation
program, including factors such as whether incentive plan metrics are
appropriate, rigorous and transparent; whether the long-term element of the compensation
program is evaluated over at least a three-year period; the sensitivity of pay
to below median performance.”</span></div><div><span style="font-size:10.5pt;line-height:115%;

interests with long-term shareholder value creation. Detailed disclosure of
compensation criteria is preferred; proof that companies follow the criteria
should be evident and retroactive performance target changes without proper
disclosure is not viewed favorably. Compensation practices should allow a

regarding how to vote for say on pay, ISS reviews the “strength of
performance-based compensation and rigor of performance goals: This key
consideration includes a review of the ratio of performance to time-based
equity awards as well as the overall ratio of performance-based compensation to
total compensation. A company that exhibits significant misalignment of pay
opportunities and performance over time would be expected to strongly emphasize
performance-based compensation (though not by simply increasing the size of the
pay package in order to make it more performance-based). ISS will review both
recent cash awards paid and the award opportunities (long-term incentive
grants) intended to drive future performance, to evaluate their performance conditions.
Time-based awards (including standard stock options and time-vesting stock
awards) that are not granted due to the attainment of pre-set goals are not
considered strongly performance-based in this context. Shareholders would also
expect such a company to fully disclose performance metrics and goals, which
should be reasonably challenging in the context of its past performance and
goals…”</span></div><div><span style="font-size:10.5pt;line-height:115%;

it is evident that poor shareholder returns relative to pay, or high pay
