As we approach earnings season, staying on top of peer’s earnings calls and industry events becomes all the more critical. Would you find it helpful to receive email alerts when the transcripts from these calls and events are published?

Ipreo’s Events &amp; Transcripts platform can be added to your BD Corporate account.

The calendar provides event dates, conference call details, contact information, and links to audio recordings of calls. The Email Alert functionality allows you to build a watch list of companies, and have the transcripts from their calls and events delivered directly to your inbox once published.
