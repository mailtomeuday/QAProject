    <textOnly>New Release Enhancements

This past weekend we released another software upgrade in our continued effort to enhance your experience in DR Insight. The release included several enhancements to BD Mail and the Goal Tracker - all based on client feedback!



The Goal Tracker, which allows you to set quantitative goals against current or prospective shareholders, is now even more powerful with the following updates:

· ‘Interact with’ selections made in the goal set up will now remain fixed – as of the date of Goal-creation – for the entire duration of a Goal, and will no longer be subject to change as institutions increase and decrease their positions

· The Progress Details table now includes additional rows of data, and the Value and Value Change columns in the Progress Details have been swapped out for Shares and Share Change

· The Goal Tracker UI has been given a minor face-lift to reflect the most recent aesthetics that have been employed in the other, newer areas of the application

· BD Mail now supports the ability to track external URL links (websites). Just like file links, users can track which recipients have clicked on a URL link and how many times

Click here to access a Quick Guide that will help familiarize you with the new changes to BD Mail and the Goal Tracker feature in DR Insight. Please contact your relationship manager with any questions or for assistance.

We would also like to remind you that to ensure an optimal experience when accessing the latest BD features, we recommend that you use the following browsers: Internet Explorer 11 or above, Mozilla Firefox 40 or above, or Google Chrome 41 or above. Safari is not currently supported, and we will be retiring support for IE 8, 9, and 10 later this year.

Lastly, the evolution of DR Insight continues – we will be delivering exciting new features throughout the year, including the introduction of our new Analytics module, a modernized Reporting UI, and redesigned Investor Profiles later this year!
