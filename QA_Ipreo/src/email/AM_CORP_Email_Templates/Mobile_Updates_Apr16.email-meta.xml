    <subject>What&apos;s New With BD Mobile</subject>
    <textOnly>Big things are happening with Ipreo BD Mobile, this is just one more step.
We’ve worked with our clients to pin down their most-used content, and to make it easier than ever to access.  Now, everything you need is in the BD Mobile Profile Overviews.

Looking Ahead
This year we’ll be aligning our mobile application with the exciting new BD desktop enhancements. The whole team will see the same great information in a consistent format, making your workflow even easier.
